# LCZ-Milan
The main objective of this project is to create a web application using Google Earth Engine (GEE) that improves the accessibility and usability of satellite imagery processing and classification functions. This app is intended to offer a user-friendly interface that goes beyond the capabilities of an existing Jupyter Notebook. It will enable comparative analysis of Sentinel-2, PRISMA, and ClimaMI datasets. Additionally, the application aims to showcase differences in accuracy and performance among various satellite data classification and the existing Notebook.
